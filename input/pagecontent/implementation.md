This IG defines the API contract for EHR systems under EHDS. The EHR system API is one part of a broader interoperability landscape: Member States operate national and cross-border infrastructure, healthcare providers deploy EHR systems, and EHR systems expose interoperability component capabilities that national and access-service infrastructure can use.

### The EHDS Interoperability Landscape

The diagram below shows the main EHDS actors and the API boundaries between them. Blue boxes represent API or scenario boundaries discussed by this IG.

### EHDS Actors

**Member States**

Member States must operate the national and cross-border infrastructure that enables EHDS primary-use exchange:

- **National interoperability infrastructure:** Member States define how health data is exchanged between healthcare providers in order to meet the both the EHDS obligations below and other national use cases. This IG does not prescribe national architecture choices, but shows how EHR systems conforming to this IG can *support* member state interoperability.

- **MyHealth@EU and National Contact Points (NCPs):** Member States must operate NCPs that connect to the MyHealth@EU central platform ([Art. 23(2)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500327#art_23)) and must ensure healthcare providers are connected to that infrastructure ([Art. 23(5)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500327#art_23)). NCP-to-NCP exchange is governed by the [NCPeH API specification](https://build-fhir.ehdsi.eu/ncp-api/), not by this IG.

- **Access services:** Member States must operate a patient-facing health data access service ([Art. 4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500327#art_4)) and a health professional access service ([Art. 12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500327#art_12)). Either can act as a consumer of the EHR system API; their service requirements are not specified here.

**Healthcare providers**

Healthcare providers deploy one or more EHR systems for care delivery, including EHR systems which support *internal* clinical workflows within an organization as well as EHR systems which support *cross-organization* exchange with national infrastructure, for example to meet the member state requirement [Art. 23(5)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500327#art_23) to connect their data to the national NCP for cross-border exchange.

**EHR systems**

EHR systems must conform to the Interoperability Component implemented in this IG. [Art. 25(1)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32025R0327#art_25) requires EHR systems to include the European interoperability software component; [Annex II §2.1–2.4](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32025R0327#anx_II) requires that component to provide and receive priority-category data in EEHRxF format. 

An EHR system may implement the API directly, or the capability may be delivered by an associated gateway or facade that is treated as part of the deployed EHR system. 

**Patient Wellness applications** — 

Wellness applications may optionally claim EHR interoperability component conformance ([Art. 47–48](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500327#art_47)); in which case they use the same API transactions defined here and are within the scope of this IG. 

Wellness applications can also be used to support the EHDS Patient right to insert data into their EHR ([Art. 5](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500327#art_5), [Art. 48(2)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500327#art_48)). This use case is not defined in this IG, but is considered for future work. 

Whether a wellness application connects directly to an EHR system directly or through the health data access service is not specified by the regulation and is left free to implementation.

### Use Cases

EHR systems can be deployed in different scenario, described below:

#### Deployment Scenarios

- [**Organization-Internal Exchange**](usecase-ehr-internal.html) — How a healthcare provider using multiple EHR systems can connect them together.

- [**Cross-Organization via National Infrastructure**](usecase-cross-org.html) — How EHR systems act as participants in national interoperability infrastructure to exchange data cross-organization.

- [**Cross-Border via NCP**](usecase-cross-border-ncp.html) — How supports cross-border exchange of data via national interobperability infrastructure, National Contact Points, and MyHealth@EU.

#### Access Service Scenarios

- [**Health Professional Access Service**](usecase-health-professional-portal.html) — Health professionals accessing EEHRxF data through a member state access service.

- [**Health Data Access Service**](usecase-health-data-portal.html) — Patients accessing their own health data through a member state access service.

- [**Wellness App Access**](usecase-wellness-app.html) — Patients accessing their own health data via Wellness Applications.
