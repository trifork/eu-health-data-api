### Overview

A **Health Professional Access Service** ([Art. 12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202500327#art_12)) enables a health professional to query patient health information from EHR systems. The service authenticates the professional, locates the patient, and queries one or more EHR systems for that patient's data.

### Scope

This IG defines the API the access service could use to query EHR systems. Requirements for the access service itself — including how the professional authenticates (e.g eIDAS), how the patient is selected, and how queries are routed across EHR systems — are governed by Member State requirements and are **out of scope** here.

### Participants

- **Health Professional Access Service** — [Document Consumer](actors.html#document-consumer) and/or [Resource Consumer](actors.html#resource-consumer)
- **EHR system** — [Document Access Provider](actors.html#document-access-provider) and/or [Resource Access Provider](actors.html#resource-access-provider)

### Workflow

1. Health professional authenticates to the access service
2. Service identifies the patient (see [Patient Lookup](patient-match.html))
3. Service queries EHR systems for [documents](document-exchange.html) and/or [resources](resource-access.html)
4. Professional reviews the retrieved data

The service may query EHR systems directly, through national infrastructure that federates queries, or through a combination — see [Cross-Organization via National Infrastructure](usecase-cross-org.html).

### Authorization

The professional's identity and authorization are established at the access service. At the EHR API surface, the consumer is an authorized system-to-system caller; the mechanism — for example SMART Backend Services credentials issued by a national authorization server — is described in [Authorization](authorization.html).
